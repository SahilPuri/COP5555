     * 
     * Be aware that escape characters in your strings will be handled by java before the string is 
     * given to your program.  In other words, if your expected input String is given in your test case code
     * as "abc\\def", what you Scanner will actually see is abc\def.  
     * If you read abc\\def from a file,  your Scanner will see abc\\def.
     * This is probably the most annoying for string literals.  To create test input String containing a 
     * string literal, you need to escape the quotes that should be passed to the scanner.
     * 
     * For example, if your actual test input (as it would appear in source code) is 
     * 
     *     print_string("this is a string literal")
     *     
     * your input string would need to be
     *     "print_string(\"this is a string literal\")"
